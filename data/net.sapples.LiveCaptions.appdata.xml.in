  <description>
    <p>Live Captions is an application that provides live captioning for the Linux desktop.</p>
    <p>Only the English language is supported currently. Other languages may produce gibberish or a bad phonetic translation.</p>
    <p>Features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Simple interface</li>
      <li>Caption desktop/mic audio locally, powered by deep learning</li>
      <li>No API keys, no proprietary services/libraries, no telemetry, no spying, no data collection, does not use network permission</li>
      <li>Adjust font, font size, and toggle uppercase/lowercase</li>
      <li>Less confident text is faded (darkened), this feature can be disabled</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Running this requires a somewhat-decent CPU that can perform realtime captioning, especially if you want to be doing other tasks (such as video decode) while running Live Captions. It has been tested working on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Intel i7-2670QM (2011)</li>
      <li>Intel i5-8265U (2018)</li>
      <li>AMD Ryzen 5 1600 (2017)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>GPU is not required or used.</p>

    <p>The live captions may not be accurate. It may make mistakes, including when it comes to numbers. Please do not rely on the results for anything critical or important.</p>
    <p>More models may be trained and released in the future with better and more robust accuracy.</p>
