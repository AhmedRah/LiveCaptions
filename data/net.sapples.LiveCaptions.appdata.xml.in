  <summary>Desktop Live Captioning for PipeWire</summary>

  <description>
    <p>
      Live Captions is an application that provides live captioning for the Linux desktop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only the English language is supported currently. Other languages may produce gibberish or a bad phonetic translation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Features: <em> Simple interface </em> Caption desktop/mic audio locally, audio is never sent anywhere <em> Does not rely on any proprietary services/libraries </em> Adjust font, font size, and text casing * Optional token-level confidence text fading
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, not all systems will be compatible. Your system must: <em> be using PipeWire sound server; </em> have a CPU powerful enough to perform live captioning faster than realtime (tested working on i7-2670QM, i5-8265U, Ryzen 5 1600)
    </p>
    <p>
      The live captions may not be accurate. It may make mistakes, including when it comes to numbers. Please do not rely on the results for anything critical or important.
